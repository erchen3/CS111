lab0.c:
C Program that utilizes the API getopt to parse command-line options such as

input- reads from file to stdout, will exit 2 if not able to read file.
       Utilizes input file redirection to accomplish this so file descriptor 0
       will refer to the file.
	
output - reads from stdin to a file, will exit 3 if not able to create file
       	 Utilizes output file redirection, file descriptor 1 will refer to file.
	 We have a general read from fd 0 and write to fd 1 and will correspond
	 accordingly.
	 
catch- catches a segfault exit 4
       expects to get a segfault or will not do "anything"
       when it gets segfault it will print a notice.
       
segfault - forces segfault.


Makefile:
	default:
		Compiles the program as specified in the specs.
	clean:
		removes everything to "clean" it up.
	dist:
		create the archived tarball.
		
	check: this target runs all smoke tests and compiles.

	sillyArg:
		first smoke test making sure that we get the proper exit status when
		we use a bad option that doesn't exist. Exit status should be 1.
	segFaultTest:
		second smoke test making sure we get proper exit status when we catch a segfault
		and the status for exit should be 4.
	OpenFile:
		3rd smoke test ensuring we get the right exits status(2) if we can't open a file.
	createFile:
		4th smoke test ensuring we get right exit status(3) if we cant create the file to write to.
	smoothRun:
		Last smoke test running --input --output simultaneously and making sure we exit successfuly.
