lab4b.c:
	Driver program utilizing GPIO/AIO API's and command-line options to utilize the Beaglebone sensors and button.
	Generates a report for each sample on the temperate and time. By default, it's reported in Fahrenheit. The user
	can pass in user-commands such as, SCALE=C/F , PERIOD=#NUMBER , LOG=LOGFILETOWRITETO, STOP, START, and OFF.
		
Makefile:
	default:
		builds the program to create the executable
	check:
		an automated smoke-test of the application verifying that it works and can talk to the sensors.
		 Uses the provided sanity check as a means to test functionality.
	clean:
		Deletes all the programs that the Makefile generates.
	dist:
		builds the tarball for homework submission.

test.sh:
	Provided sanity checker that verifies functionality of the program used in check.
