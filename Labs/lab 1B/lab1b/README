lab1b-client:
	This program is	part 1 of 2 that contributes to	passing	input and output over a	TCP socket and is the client side.
	You must set up	the server first and specify the port number in	order to utilize this program
	It takes two options,
	--compress   will deflate/inflate data sent over I/O
        --log=LogFile     will write sent/received data	to a log file
        --port=PortNum	  specifies the	port number to connect on


lab1b-server:
	This program is	part 2 of 2 that contributes to	passing	input and output over a	TCP socket and is the server side.
	This program utilizes much of the functionality	as of 1A where we fork a process. In a high-level this handles I/O
        from the client	and shell.
        It takes,
        --port=PortNum	specifies port number to set up	connection
        --compress	will deflate/inflate data sent over I/O

Makefile:
	default: Compile lab1b-client.c	and lab1b-server.c properly as specified
	
        clean: "Cleans"	all the	files that are tar.gz's	.txt's and executables
		
        dist: Compresses the necessary files such as README, Makefile, lab1b-client.c lab1b-server.c for submission

I read the man pages for functions I wasn't familiar with and stackOverflow for compiling mistakes such as
using the gcc flag -lz.
